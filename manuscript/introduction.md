# Scala For Programmers
W> This is a work in progress! Check back regularly for updated versions.

This book is for programmers who are interested in learning the Scala language. It is designed to give you a concise introduction to the essentials of programming in Scala. It won't visit all the dark corners or deal with many advanced topics, but by the end of the book you should be confident to start using Scala in projects, and have a good idea of where to go next.

## Who's This Book For?

I'm assuming that you're a programmer, either a professional or serious amateur. That means I'm assuming the following knowledge on your part:

   * You already know how to program in a high-level language, such as Python or Java

   * You know something about OO programming

   * You can find your way around your chosen operating system, and are happy with installing and configuring software

I'm not assuming that you know anything about functional programming - we'll talk a lot about that when we get there.

## How I Approach Scala

If you care about writing good code, then you know that it isn't good enough for code to use the latest languages and tools. It has to be tested and maintainable, and if you work in a commercial environment, that might mean you having to visit code you wrote a year ago at 3am on a Sunday morning, in order to fix an outage.

So we'll mention build tools and testing as we go, and there will be minimum of flashy, show-off stuff, especially when we get to the functional part. The emphasis is on writing solid code to Get Stuff Done.
