# A-Introduction to Functional Theory

A brief intro to some of the theory behind functional programming.

This won't satisfy anyone who has a computer science background, but is intended to provide a lightweight introduction for those who are developers first and theorists second.

This appendix introduces some of the concepts that underly a lot of the functional programming. It isn't necessary to understand these concepts in order to use Scala to write production code, but a basic knowledge will help you to understand how some things work, and more importantly, why things work the way they do.

For a more theoretically complete treatment, I'd highly recommend Bartosz Milewski's [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) articles.
