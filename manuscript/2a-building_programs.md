# Building Programs

The REPL is an excellent tool - and I'll use it a lot in this book - but you need to be able to build applications and libraries.

This chapter will cover build tools, starting with the simplest and working up from there.

## IDEs

Java and C# developers are used to using complex and fully-featured development environments, such as Eclipse and Visual Studio. Three of the most popular Java IDEs have plugins that make them good Scala development tools. These three are:

* IntelliJ, which can be found at <http://www.jetbrains.com/idea>
* NetBeans, which can be found at <http://netbeans.org>
* ScalaIDE, which is based on Eclipse, and which can be found at <http://scala-ide.org>

Each of them offers a free edition, so you can try them all and decide which one you prefer. In addition, all of them support "worksheets", editor panes that function like a graphical REPL window.

I'm not going to talk about IDEs any further, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we're here to talk about Scala, not about tooling, and so we'll use the simplest tools that do the job. Secondly, things keep changing, and anything you read here about an IDE may be out of date by the time the next version is released.
