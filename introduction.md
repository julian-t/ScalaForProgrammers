# Scala For Programmers
W> This is a work in progress! Check back regularly for updated versions.

This book is for programmers who are interested in learning the Scala language.

I'm assuming the following knowledge on your part:

   * You already know how to program in a high-level language, such as Python or Java

   * You have a basic knowledge of OO programming

   * You can find your way around your chosen operating system, and are happy with installing and configuring software

I'm not assuming that you know anything about functional programming - we'll talk a lot about that when we get there.

Also available in PDF, ePub and Mobi formats from LeanPub
